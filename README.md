Documentation y discussion space to develop XR tools for Odoo

## Introduction

The main idea of this repository is has a high level space/environment to identify and evaluate different case of uses of Extended Reality (XR) on Odoo.

## Brief description to collaborate in this repo

You can use [issue section](https://github.com/odooxr/initiative/issues) to include different discussion of this [topics](https://github.com/odooxr/initiative/labels).
For example, a case of use will start as an issue, with a simple description to start a discussion. 
After initial discussions, if the community finds value in the proposal, a [wiki page](https://github.com/odooxr/initiative/wiki) will be created to consolidate the idea.
Of course, it can trigger new issues for technology implementation or architecture design and then continue with new wiki pages.
This circular process needs to create a set of tasks to develop and increase the inititive.

Wellcome to our VR initiative to ERP systems.
